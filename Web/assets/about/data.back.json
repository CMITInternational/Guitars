    "Description": [
        "Phillip has recently retired from a working life of farming, the military and the construction industry.  He has settled in the hills above Perth in Western Australia, and working alone in his small workshop builds just a handful of handcrafted classical guitars a year.",
        "Inspired by the Ignacio Feta’s 1962-67 guitars and handcrafted from Australian native tone woods, these guitars have brilliant bell like trebles and balanced clear deep base tones.  The guitars require a gentle action to achieve excellent volume with exceptional sustain."
